# Object Detection App

This project implements a simple **Object Detection** system using the **YOLOv5** model, which detects and identifies objects in uploaded images. The app is built using **Streamlit** and provides an intuitive interface for real-time object detection.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload an image in JPG, PNG, or JPEG format.
- **Object Detection**: Detect and identify objects in the uploaded image.
- **Real-time Results**: See the detected objects with bounding boxes and their confidence scores immediately after uploading the image.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLOv5**: Pre-trained model for object detection.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building interactive web applications.
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning library used for the YOLOv5 model.
- **OpenCV**: Library used for image manipulation and conversion.
